Hi, I'm Ethan Struby; I'm an assistant professor of Economics at Carleton College in Minnesota


I mostly use github to share Shiny applications I've written for pedagogical purposes, but eventually I might share other research projects in matlab/R/Julia.


I'm most easily reachable at estruby AT carleton DOT edu
